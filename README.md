## Introduction 
This is a "Life Balance Assessment" written for CEEK LLC during my time as an intern there. The purpose of the assessment is to help people determine how balanced their priorities are in life with an initial evaluation, and then provide advice for finding better life balance. The assessment was written to be paired with my boss's book, "Naviagte Chaos: A 5-Step Guide to Balance Work, Family, and Other Life Priorities".

I was told that I could develop the assessment in any way that I see fit and would be paid for my time learning new programming languages if need be. I ultimately decided to code the assessment in *JavaScript*, *HTML*, and *CSS* and taught myself these three programming languages in the early stages of development. For the backend of the assessment, I decided to use a Google Sheet because the assessment does not collect sensitive information and I wanted it to be user-friendly for when I part from CEEK LLC. Having Google Sheets as the backend would not require a programmer to maintain it. All it required was for me to have a basic understanding of *Google Apps Script* to be able to push data to the spreadsheet.

## Milestones
* August 26, 2018: The first complete version of the assessment was released for free trial mode.
* October 10, 2018: My boss's book, "Navigate Chaos: A 5-Step Guide to Balance Work, Family, and Other Life Priorities", was released and the access code was turned on for the assessment.

## Parameters
The basic parameters given were:
* Access code for the assessment that allows users to take it twice, once for an initial evaluation and again after several months to measure personal growth
* Demographic survey at the beginning to get basic, non-identifying information about the user taking the assessment
* Users type their own priority areas and must provide 4-10
* The assessment must have two sections, one for "Do you..." and one for "Are you willing to..." questions
* A PDF report is generated at the end to provide results
